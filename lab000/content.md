SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Tue Sep 3 13:24:23 2019

SQL> -- clone PDB1 as MASKED
SQL> create pluggable database masked from pdb1 keystore identified by "MyWalPwd#1";
Pluggable database created.

SQL> alter pluggable database masked open read write;

You can then connect to emcc as oracle and check whether the whole stack has been started by executing:

/u01/oracle/fmw/bin/emctl status oms

Wait until the whole stack is up

## Step 3 : Cloning PDB1 ##

We start this exercise by creating a new pluggable database named **MASKED** as a clone of the production pluggable database PDB1. We will later run an **in-database anonymization** of PDB MASKED.

Using a terminal window to secdb, execute mask20_clone.sh to clone PDB1

````
$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab09_masking</copy>
````

````
$ <copy>mask20_clone.sh</copy>

SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Fri Apr 24 14:45:38 2020
Version 19.6.0.0.0
Connected.

SQL> -- clone PDB1 as MASKED
SQL> create pluggable database masked from pdb1 keystore identified by "MyWalletPwd#1";
Pluggable database created.

SQL> alter pluggable database masked open read write;
Pluggable database altered.
````

To mask data and also because we operate in a Database Vault environment, we need to grant additional privileges to SYSTEM on MASKED.
